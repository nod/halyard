**halyard** hăl′yərd  _noun_
> A rope used to raise or lower a sail, flag, or yard.

**tl;dr** - use halyard to track the status of jobs or services or servers

Much like signal flags on the sailing ships of the past, **halyard** is an
application that lets you communicate on the state of anything just by sending 
very simple bits of data to a central location.  That central service can then
be queried to get a very direct view of the system in question.

In simplest terms, anything can be watched and verified visually.

The possible states are: `OK`  `WARN`  `CRITICAL`  `DEAD` `EXPIRED`
